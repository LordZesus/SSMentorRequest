        <p>Welcome to the Summoner School Discordâ€™s mentor request system!</p>
        <p>
          Our mentors are here to help those who are serious about improving
          their gameplay and do that primarily through VOD reviews. The aim of
          mentoring is to provide you, the student, with general directions and
          learning objectives. If you meet the minimum requirements for a VOD
          review, a mentor will be reaching out to you through DMs. Please
          remember this is a free, volunteer-based service and wait times may
          vary depending on your rank, position, timezone, and mentor
          availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are new or do not meet the requirements below but are still
          looking for a vod review, please use the #vod-review channel for a
          community review (check the pins for how to get started). Any other
          gameplay questions can be posted in any of the educational channels.
        </p>

          We encourage you to consider a game that is representative of YOUR
          average solo queue experience. Before submitting a game, review it
          briefly to understand what went wrong or well. Identify major
          weaknesses and areas for improvement. Focus on overarching habits and
          general gameplay, not specific details. Ask yourself things like
          &#34;Do I keep dying to jungler ganks?&#34; or &#34;Do my waves
          somehow end up in bad positions?&#34; Come up with some questions to
          ask your mentor so you can get the most out of the session.

            requirements. Exceptions can be made for very active players at the
